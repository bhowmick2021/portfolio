# About

I’ve spent over 15 years working across analytics, BI platforms, and data engineering—long enough to see what scales, what breaks, and what quietly becomes expensive.

I started my career building internal reporting systems and BI portals, moved through platform engineering and cloud migration, and eventually took ownership of analytics platforms and governance at scale.

What I enjoy most is not building dashboards—it’s fixing systems that have grown messy:
- unclear ownership  
- rising cloud costs  
- fragile pipelines  
- low trust in data  

I work best in environments where judgment matters more than headcount.

## How I Work

- I prefer short, focused engagements  
- I optimize for clarity, not complexity  
- I leave teams with systems they understand and can run  

I don’t sell tools.  
I help teams make better decisions about the ones they already have.

## Quiet Credibility

- 15+ years across BI, analytics platforms, and data engineering  
- Led analytics modernization and FinOps initiatives saving ~$50K+/year  
- Platforms used across marketing, finance, sales, and leadership teams  
- Experience spanning on-prem systems, GCP, BigQuery, and Tableau  
- Worked with global teams across India, APAC, and Europe

## Engagement Model

I usually work in one of these ways:

- **Platform or Cost Review (2–4 weeks)**  
- **Modernization or Migration Planning**  
- **FinOps & Governance Advisory**  
- **Fractional Analytics Leadership**

I don’t take on:
- Open-ended delivery work  
- Staff-augmentation roles  
- “Build everything” projects without ownership clarity
