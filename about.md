# About

I work at the intersection of **data engineering**, **BI platforms**, and **cost governance**—building systems that stay reliable after the first launch.

I’ve spent 15+ years moving from reporting and BI into platform ownership: migrations, modernization, automation, and governance patterns that make analytics easier to run. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

## How I work (what you can expect)

- 🧩 I prefer **small, focused scopes** with clear deliverables
- 🧾 I document decisions + handover so teams can run it after
- 🔍 I optimize for **clarity and maintainability**, not cleverness
- 📊 I’ll show the numbers: spend patterns, reliability signals, adoption signals

## Engagement boundaries (so projects don’t get messy)

**Good fit**
- Platform / cost review (1–2 weeks)
- Modernization or migration plan (2–4 weeks)
- FinOps + governance advisory (ongoing, light-touch)
- Automation pilots (alerts, monitoring, internal workflows)

**Not a fit**
- Open-ended “own everything” delivery with unclear ownership
- Staff-augmentation without a defined outcome
- Build-first when the root issue is governance/decision-making

## Quick credibility (quiet, not loud)

- Built and modernized platforms using **GCP/BigQuery + Tableau** :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
- Automation patterns using **n8n + LLM orchestration** :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- Delivered self-serve data products + adoption improvements :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
