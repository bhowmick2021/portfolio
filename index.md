### Analytics Platforms • BigQuery FinOps • BI Governance

I help teams fix analytics platforms that have grown expensive, fragile, or hard to trust.

Most of my work sits at the intersection of **data engineering, BI platforms, and cost governance**. I’ve spent 15+ years building and running analytics systems—from early internal reporting portals to large-scale cloud platforms on BigQuery and Tableau.

This site is a working record of how I think, what I’ve solved, and how I typically help.

## 🧭 What I Help With


- BigQuery cost optimization and FinOps guardrails  
- Analytics platform modernization and technical debt reduction  
- Self-serve BI design that doesn’t break governance  
- BI reliability, monitoring, and metadata visibility  

If your analytics stack technically works but feels risky, expensive, or slow to evolve, that’s usually where I step in.

## ▶️ Start Here

Most conversations begin with a short review or audit.

No long contracts. No big promises up front.

If you want a second set of eyes on:
- BigQuery spend and usage patterns  
- BI platform architecture  
- Governance, reliability, or adoption issues  

you can reach me here:

If you’re unsure whether a short review would help, that’s usually a good place to start.
