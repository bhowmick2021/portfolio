# Abhijeet Bhowmick  
**Data Platforms • BigQuery FinOps • BI Governance • Automation (n8n + LLMs)**

I help teams fix analytics platforms that have grown **expensive**, **fragile**, or **hard to trust**.  
15+ years building and modernizing data systems across cloud + BI, with a bias for measurable outcomes.  
(Short engagements. Clear scope. Clean handover.)

---

## ✅ What I help with

- 💸 **BigQuery cost optimization**: spend patterns, guardrails, chargeback/showback, right-sizing
- 🧱 **Platform modernization**: technical-debt reduction, reliability, ownership, standards
- 📊 **Self-serve BI**: governed datasets, extract monitoring, “fewer ad-hoc requests”
- 🤖 **Automation & GenAI workflows**: n8n pipelines, alerts, summarization, internal enablement

## 🧭 Start here (no sales pitch)

Most conversations start with a short review. If you want a second set of eyes on:

- BigQuery spend spikes or unpredictable bills  
- Tableau/BI reliability, extracts, refresh failures  
- Governance gaps: ownership, duplication, low trust  
- Migration planning without breaking reporting
