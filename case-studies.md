# Case Studies  
Real platform work (not demo projects). Metrics are representative of delivered outcomes.

---

## 1) BigQuery Migration + Cost Optimization  
**Theme:** Cloud modernization + FinOps discipline  
**Stack:** GCP • BigQuery • SQL • Tableau

### Situation
Legacy warehouse + mixed patterns led to slow delivery and unpredictable query costs.

### What I did
- Re-designed data model + ETL/ELT flows
- Introduced partitioning, clustering, and query tuning
- Added spend visibility, usage-based attribution, and alerting
- Set governance patterns so the savings stayed

### Outcomes
- ⏱️ ETL processing improved (reported up to **80%** faster in critical paths) :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- 💸 Reduced query/storage cost via optimization patterns (reported **~30–40%** on heavy workloads) :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- 🧭 Established ongoing cost controls and monitoring :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## 2) Technical Debt Reduction + Platform Modernization  
**Theme:** Reliability + clarity + ownership  
**Stack:** BigQuery • Tableau • Governance

### Situation
Years of incremental BI growth caused duplicated logic, fragmented pipelines, and maintenance drag.

### What I did
- Audited pipelines, scheduled queries, extracts, and “who owns what”
- Standardized datasets and conventions (naming, lifecycle, documentation)
- Implemented performance policies and quality scorecards
- Reduced duplication and improved trust

### Outcomes
- 📉 Lower compute waste via lifecycle policies + optimization patterns
- ✅ Better reliability and “less surprise breakage” across reporting

---

## 3) Self-Serve BI Platform Launch  
**Theme:** Reduce ad-hoc load, improve adoption  
**Stack:** GCP • BigQuery • Tableau

### Situation
Central BI teams were overloaded with recurring questions and custom extracts.

### What I did
- Built governed shared datasets and a BI hub
- Defined access patterns and documentation
- Created repeatable onboarding so teams could self-serve

### Outcomes
- 🙅 Reduced ad-hoc requests (reported ~**50%** in rollout areas) :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- ⚡ Faster insight turnaround and higher adoption :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

---

## 4) BI Extract Monitoring + Alert Automation  
**Theme:** Operational BI reliability  
**Stack:** BigQuery metadata • n8n • Tableau

### Situation
Extract failures and stale dashboards created downtime and invisible data drift.

### What I did
- Built monitoring signals from metadata + usage patterns
- Automated alerting and routing (team-appropriate notifications)
- Reduced “manual chasing” and improved response time

### Outcomes
- 🛠️ Lower incident load and faster detection (reported improvements in downtime reduction)

---

## 5) AI-Powered Industry News Automation  
**Theme:** Internal enablement via automation  
**Stack:** n8n • LLM summarization • Slack/email

### Situation
Stakeholders needed a daily signal without manual curation.

### What I did
- Aggregated sources, summarized, tagged, and distributed updates
- Owned orchestration + scheduling + delivery pipeline

### Outcomes
- 🧠 Reduced manual curation effort (reported ~**90%**) :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

### Fast-turnaround vendor integrations (10–15 day builds)
When the need is “get this data usable fast”: multi-format ingestion, automation, and stable datasets. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
