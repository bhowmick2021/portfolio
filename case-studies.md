## BigQuery Migration & Cost Optimization

**Context**  
A legacy MySQL warehouse and partial cloud migration resulted in slow analytics delivery and unpredictable BigQuery costs.

**Approach**  
- Re-designed data models and ETL workflows  
- Introduced partitioning, clustering, and scheduled query tuning  
- Built usage-based cost visibility and alerts  
- Established a FinOps-driven governance model

**Impact**  
- ~80% reduction in ETL processing time  
- ~30% lower storage and compute costs  
- ~$50K annual cloud savings  
- Multiple self-serve datasets for business teams

## Technical Debt Reduction & Platform Modernization

**Context**  
Years of incremental BI growth led to fragmented pipelines, duplicated logic, and rising maintenance costs.

**Approach**  
- Audited BigQuery pipelines, Tableau extracts, and scheduled queries  
- Consolidated data sources into governed datasets  
- Introduced lifecycle, documentation, and quality standards

**Impact**  
- ~45% reduction in query scan volume  
- ~35% reduction in monthly compute costs  
- Improved platform reliability and data trust

## Self-Serve BI Platform Launch

**Context**  
Central BI teams were overloaded with ad-hoc requests, slowing decision-making.

**Approach**  
- Designed a shared BI hub on GCP and Tableau  
- Defined governed datasets and access patterns  
- Enabled teams to explore data independently

**Impact**  
- ~50% reduction in ad-hoc requests  
- ~20% faster insight turnaround  
- Higher adoption of standardized analytics

## BI Extract Monitoring & Alert Automation

**Context**  
BI failures were detected only after business impact.

**Approach**  
- Built automated monitoring using metadata and workflow orchestration  
- Flagged stale dashboards, failed refreshes, and heavy usage

**Impact**  
- ~70% reduction in BI downtime incidents  
- Proactive issue detection  
- Improved trust in analytics delivery
