## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

Hello and welcome! I‚Äôm Abhijeet Bhowmick ‚Äî a curious problem-solver who has spent the last 15+ years turning scattered data into stories that spark action. My journey began in the fast-paced world of tech support, where I learned the importance of clear processes and creative thinking under pressure. Over time, I found my true calling: building data platforms that help people make better, faster decisions.

From **leading cloud migrations** that trimmed costs by 30% and boosted performance, to designing automated reporting systems that free up entire workweeks, I‚Äôve focused on blending technical precision with tangible business value.

Over the years, I‚Äôve:  
- üìà Shaped data strategies that align seamlessly with business goals  
- üîç Delivered insightful dashboards and analytics tools (Tableau, Power BI)  
- ‚ö° Automated complex workflows to improve speed and reliability  

For me, data is never just numbers ‚Äî it‚Äôs a living story. Each project is a new chapter, and I‚Äôm always looking for the next one to tell.
